# Textify: Your Efficient Text Manipulation Tool üìù
 Welcome to Textify ! It's a simple React.js-based application that allows users to modify, copy, and manipulate text efficiently. This project was built as part of my learning journey with React.js, covering concepts like components, routing, event handling etc. üöÄ


## üíª Getting Started
 This project was bootstrapped with <b>Create React App</b>. \
 To run this application on your local machine, ensure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.

## üí° Installation
 Follow these steps to get the Textify project up and running on your local environment : 

 <b> 1. Clone the repository : </b> Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone this project. Then, execute the following command :  git clone https://github.com/Coder-dev-sys/textify.git

 <b> 2. Navigate to the project directory : </b> Once the repository is cloned, change your current directory to the newly created textify folder, by executing the following command :  cd textify

 <b> 3. Install dependencies : </b> Use either npm or yarn to install the project's dependencies, which are listed in the package.json file. \
    <b> - Using npm : </b> npm install 
    
 <b> 4. Running the Application : </b> After successfully installing the dependencies, you can start the React development server using the following command : npm start \
    - This command will typically start the development server, and the application will be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:3000 or a similar address. The console will usually indicate the exact URL where the application is running.
