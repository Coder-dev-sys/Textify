# Textify: Your Efficient Text Manipulation Tool 📝
- Welcome to Textify ! It's a simple React.js-based application that allows users to modify, copy, and manipulate text efficiently. This project was built as part of my learning journey with React.js, covering concepts like components, routing, event handling etc. 🚀


## 💻 Getting Started
- This project was bootstrapped with <b>npm create-react-app Textify</b>. 
- To run this application on your local machine, ensure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
